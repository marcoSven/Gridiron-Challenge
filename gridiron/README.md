# Gridiron Challenge #


Notes:

No specified color for the touchdown area.

Tried to use the style guide repository but it is missing -  git@github.com:sendgrid/style-guide.git

Created a flex box grid instead of using the SendGrid grid.

The total length of the football field is 120 yards including border. The playing field is 100 yards.

If the border needs to be excluded, change  "box-sizing" property on the #field to "content-box".

Wrapped football field in stadium section to restrict width to 1000px.

Added touch support so scrimmage line can be dragged on mobile touch devices. 
Refresh when you switch from click to touch in developer tools.
